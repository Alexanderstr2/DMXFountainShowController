# DMXFountainShowController
Controller code for DMX control of water pumps using PWM.

## Arduino Implementation

**Simple**
This simply decodes DMX into PWM to drive fountains
**Advanced**
This decodes DMX into PWM to drive fountains, it also included an LCD controller to set address on the unit.

**COMING SOON Live**
The code I use in production, live will also be able to control relays as well as have LCD feedback.

**COMING SOON Milliumin**
This was my intital version of the show control. Advantage to using Milliumin Library is that it enabled bidrictional communication allowing inputs such as a show start button to drive the show. This may be also implemented into the main DMX stream using RDM soon.

## FPGA Implementation

**COMING SOON**
FPGA implementation will implementation DMX decoding and PWM functions in VHDL for an FPGA based control system.

## Hardware

**COMING SOON**
